# ATRV-JR Description
This repository is a ROS2 Package for the virtual model of the ATRV-JR robot.

This package was made for use in the University of Massachusetts Lowell HRI Lab, and its authors are Logan Sehr and Ted Boswell.

## Prerequisites
This package uses ROS2 Humble and its functionality has not been tested across other ROS versions.

## Collaborative Package
This package has RVIZ launch files that work together with the atrvjr_gazebo package which can be found [`here`](https://github.com/logansehr11/atrvjr_gazebo). 

It is in future plans to move all RVIZ functionality to either the collaborative package or a new one altogether.
